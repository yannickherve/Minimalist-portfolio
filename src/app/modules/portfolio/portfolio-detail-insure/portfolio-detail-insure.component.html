          This was a small project which mostly consisted of HTML and CSS. I built a
          fully-responsive landing page. The only JavaScript this project required was
          to enable the toggling of the mobile navigation.

            This project was a front-end  challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that
            enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge
            includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different
            screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve
            real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each project, helping
            me to improve and adapt my style.
